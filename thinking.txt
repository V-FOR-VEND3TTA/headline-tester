The logic behind this:

To get you started, here's a high-level outline of the steps you can take to create such a web application:

**Step 1: Define the Purpose and Features:**
Decide on the main purpose of your web application. 
Will it be a tool for analyzing ad performance, generating ad copy, or providing ad optimization tips? 
Outline the features you want to include, such as data entry forms, analytics dashboards, or A/B testing functionalities.

**Step 2: Choose the Technology Stack:**
Select the programming languages, frameworks, and tools you will use to develop the web application. 
Common choices for web development include HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Python, Ruby, or Node.js for the backend.

**Step 3: Design the User Interface (UI):**
Create wireframes and design mockups for your web application's user interface.
Ensure it is intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing.

**Step 4: Data Collection and Storage:**
Determine how you will collect and store data related to ad campaigns. 
This may involve setting up a database to store ad performance metrics and user inputs.

**Step 5: Implement Ad Analysis Algorithms:**
Develop algorithms to analyze ad performance metrics, identify areas for improvement, and generate optimization recommendations. This could include sentiment analysis, A/B testing calculations, or demographic targeting insights.

**Step 6: Build the Backend:**
Create the backend of your web application to handle data processing, analytics, and communication with the frontend.

**Step 7: Develop the Frontend:**
Build the frontend of the web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implement the UI you designed earlier and integrate it with the backend functionalities.

**Step 8: Test and Debug:**
Thoroughly test your web application to ensure it functions correctly and is free of bugs. Conduct both unit testing and user testing to validate its usability.

**Step 9: Deploy the Web Application:**
Choose a web hosting service to deploy your application. Ensure it is accessible to your target audience.

**Step 10: Monitor and Improve:**
Monitor user interactions and feedback with the application to identify areas for improvement. Regularly update the application to add new features and enhance its performance.

Remember, building a web application is a complex process that may require collaboration with developers, designers, and possibly data analysts. If you don't have the technical expertise, consider seeking help from web development professionals or exploring online platforms that facilitate the creation of web applications with minimal coding.

Additionally, you may want to conduct market research to identify specific pain points and needs of marketers to tailor your web application's features accordingly. Good luck with your project!
